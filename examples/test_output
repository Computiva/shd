This example shows a simple command execution and its expected output. The
command is followed by a $ char and then its expected output is followed by a <
char.

$ echo "This is a test case."
< This is a test case.

Here is a two line example.

$ test_var=2
$ expr 3 + $test_var
< 5

And an example expecting two output lines. Note that you have to escape the \
escape char to send a escape char.

$ echo -e "test 1\\ntest 2"
< test 1
< test 2
